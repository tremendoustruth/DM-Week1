// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

//Answer: The steps should be organized as follows: Planning, Analysis of Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing and Integration, Maintain 

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the stage in which the team determines the feasibility of the project. It includes a cost-benefit analysis against the needs of the stakeholders, the business, and the users."
const design = "This stage transforms the original plan into a rough structure of the software, which is comprised of system design, programming languages, security needs, appropriate platforms, user experience, and other details. In many cases, a prototype is created in this stage to see how the softtware responds to user actions."
const implementation = "This can also be called the development phase. During this stage, the development team translates features into the code that creates the end product."
const testAndIntegration = "This stage includes various tests to ensure compliance with all requirements before deploying to the end user."
const maintain = "This stage is typically where the software is evaluated in a post-production environment to determine further imrovements and correct bugs. In an agile style of development, teams revert back to the first stage, usually in two week cycles."
